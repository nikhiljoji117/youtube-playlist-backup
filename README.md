# YouTube Playlist Backup  
A Python tool to backup YouTube playlists into structured Excel files using the YouTube Data API.  

## About this project  
This script connects to your YouTube account via **OAuth 2.0**, fetches all your playlists (including private), and saves them into a single Excel workbook.  
Each playlist is exported to its **own sheet**, with videos sorted from oldest to newest.  
At the end of 2024 there was a bug in Youtube where many accounts including mine were flagged and all the playlist was lost. Although it was fixed a few hours later, I really want to avoid that and is the main reason for making this.
